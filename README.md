# Flight Fare Finder

(source: https://github.com/uopsdod/claude-2-flight-price-notifier/blob/m0-landing-page/.claude/skills/m0-landing-and-signin/SKILL.md)

Build a SaaS landing page + authenticated app shell for Flight Price Notifier (機票降價通知), a product that watches popular flight routes from Taipei and emails the user when the cheapest fare drops to or below their target price — targeted at budget-driven travelers who don't care exactly when they fly, they just want a ticket under their budget.

The site must include:

A public landing page (/) with:

Hero section: product name "Flight Price Notifier" prominently displayed, value prop 「設定航線與目標價，機票降價就通知你」 (English subtitle: "Set a route and a target price — we email you when the fare drops."), and a primary CTA button labeled "Sign in / 登入" in the top-right header.

Features section with exactly 3 feature cards:

Card 1: 「盯緊熱門航線 (Always-on route watching)」 — 持續監控台北出發的熱門航線（東京、首爾），自動抓最低票價。

Card 2: 「達標自動通知 (Target-price email alerts)」 — 低於你設定的目標價，就寄 email 提醒你，附上立即訂購連結。

Card 3: 「隨時取消 (Cancel anytime)」 — 月訂閱制，不想用隨時停，沒有綁約。

Authentication using Lovable's built-in Supabase-style auth (use whatever auth backend Lovable provides by default — Lovable Cloud is fine for this v1; we'll swap to a user-owned Supabase project in a later step):

Sign Up page with email + password

Sign In page with email + password

Sign Out functionality

Email confirmation can be disabled for simplicity in this v1

An authenticated app shell at /app that the user lands on after signing in:

Greets the signed-in user by email: 「Hi {user.email}」

A placeholder message: 「你的航線追蹤儀表板即將上線 — 下一個里程碑會加上訂閱航線的功能。」 (English: "Your dashboard is coming soon. Route-subscription will be added in the next milestone.")

A Sign Out button in the header

Design requirements:

Modern, professional dark theme (purple/violet accent on a near-black background)

Use Inter or a similar sans-serif font

Mobile responsive

Tasteful subtle animations (fade-in on scroll is fine; don't overdo it)

Out of scope for this v1: route-subscription form, target-price input, fare display, payment, custom database tables (do NOT create a subscriptions or profiles table — only use Supabase's default auth.users). Those come in later milestones. Stick to landing page + auth + placeholder dashboard.

This project is a static Vite + React single-page app. It uses React Router for client-side routing and Supabase Auth for authentication.

## Development

You need Node.js and npm — [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

```sh
git clone <this-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a production bundle with:

```sh
npm run build
```

The static output is written to `dist/`. `vercel.json` configures Vercel to serve `index.html` for client-side routes such as `/app`, `/sign-in`, and `/sign-up`.

Set `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in the Vercel project environment before deploying.
